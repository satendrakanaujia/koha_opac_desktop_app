# Library OPAC Desktop Application

This custom desktop application is designed for browsing the Koha OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) for library organizations. Built on a Node.js environment, it provides a simple and focused interface to access the library's OPAC. The application ensures that users can only browse the specified OPAC URL, making it ideal for library settings.

## Features

- Full-screen browsing of the Koha OPAC
- Restriction to a single specified OPAC URL
- Configurable OPAC URL settings
- Auto-start functionality on system boot

## Requirements

- Node.js

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aravindrnair05/koha_opac_desktop_app.git
cd koha_opac_desktop_app
```

### 2. Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

### 3. Configure the OPAC URL

- **Step 1**: Replace the OPAC URL in the `index.html` file:
  Locate the `<iframe>` tag and update the `src` attribute with your desired OPAC URL:

  ```html
  <iframe id="webview" src="<<YOUR_OPACURL>>"></iframe>
  ```

- **Step 2**: Replace the OPAC URL in the `main.js` file:
  Find the `win.loadURL()` function and update it with your OPAC URL:

  ```javascript
  win.loadURL('<<YOUR_OPACURL>>');
  ```

### 4. Run the Application
Once you have configured the OPAC URLs, run the `autostart.bat` file to launch the application:

```bash
./autostart.bat
```

If you want the application to auto-start with your system, place the `autostart.bat` file in the auto-start location of your PC. This will ensure that the application launches automatically whenever the system boots.
